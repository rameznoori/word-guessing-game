# Word Guessing Game with Hangman Figure in Python

This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic word-guessing game, Hangman. The program challenges players to uncover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time within a limited number of attempts. Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to losing, while success is achieved by revealing the complete word before exhausting all available chances. This project demonstrates the use of Python for interactive gameplay and highlights concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
